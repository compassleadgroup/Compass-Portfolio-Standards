# CHANGELOG.md

Every standards change, dated. Newest first.

## 2026-07-02

Initial canonical standards repo created. Migrated compliance, build, tenant activation. Deprecated conflicting legacy files.

Detail:

- Created README.md, COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS.md, BUILD_PLAYBOOK.md, FORBIDDEN_LANGUAGE.md, SCHEMA_WHITELIST.md, VOICE.md, TENANT_ACTIVATION.md, CHANGELOG.md.
- Installed the compass-portfolio plugin with six commands: /new-site, /new-page, /compliance-audit, /gsc-analysis, /tenant-package, /em-dash-check.
- Migration caveat: the prior standalone copies of COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS.md, RANK_AND_RENT_BUILD_PLAYBOOK.md, and TENANT_ACTIVATION_PLAYBOOK.md were not reachable from the migration session (this repo started empty and the session had no access to the repos holding the originals). The canonical versions here were reconstructed from the Tier 0 handoff specification and carry provenance notes for operator verification.
- Legacy files MASTER_BUILD_PROMPT.md and PROJECT_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md do not exist in this repo and could not be reached from the migration session. They are deprecated by policy (see README conflict rule). They still need to be archived or deleted in whichever repo holds them.
